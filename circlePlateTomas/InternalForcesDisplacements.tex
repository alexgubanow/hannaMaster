\nosection{Internal forces and displacements}
The equilibrium of finite element method used to solve the mentioned annular
plate. The results were obtained from a MATLAB commands. Based on these
calculations, the results shows the internal forces and the a distribution of
global displacements along our structure. The results shows that the maximum
displacement was $U$ = 36.0471 mm in the direction gravity. The allowable
displacement was $U_{allowable}$ = L/250 = 64 mm so, the verification was correct
based on the current geometry and material properties. Some parametric analysis
were done for plate thickness as a very important parameter to reduce the
displacement values.
